👨🏻‍💻 I am currently completing my PhD thesis at the Université de Haute-Alsace, titled "Learning Methods into Metaheuristics," which focuses on integrating machine learning, particularly regression models, with metaheuristics to tackle time-intensive optimization problems like the Facility Location Problem.

🔬 My research interests are in using machine learning methods into metaheuristics for real-world complex optimization problems.

📚 My research has been published in prestigious journals and international conferences.

👨🏻‍🔬 I also have experience in in the industry as a software development engineer, working with C++, Python, as well as web technologies.
